# EcoAmp



1. What is EcoAmp? Its name comes from the fact that it was designed to be a software for ecologists to analyse Amplicon data. Maybe some functions related to metagenomics will be added later, and what the name of the software will be will be a matter for later.
2. Why did you develop this software? During my undergraduate studies, I came from a biology background, and I often use TBtools developed by Mr. Chen to process some data, which I think is very useful. Then after a master's degree, I came into contact with the field of ecology, and my main deal was the processing and analysis of amplicon data. Then I think every time I learn a new analysis, I have to learn code all the time, the cost and time of learning R language is more, I was thinking about whether I can integrate some mainstream analysis methods and R language scripts into a software, of course, there are many online analysis websites on the Internet, I found that some of their problems are mainly online data, their own data has a certain risk, and there are not enough parameters, and then there is a fee to limit the opening of members or something, So I integrated the R code (some of which was Python scripting) that I've been using for some time into a single piece of software, and EcoAmp came into being.
3. What are its functions? At present, there are more than 50 functions, mainly including the downstream analysis of amplicon data, such as one-click leveling of OTU, calculation of dilution curves, batch calculation of α diversity, batch drawing of histogram boxplots and statistical significance labeling, hierarchical segmentation of PCoA, NMDS, RDA, CCA, rdacca.hp, one-click calculation of random forest, linear fitting, intra-group (between) correlation heat map, Mantel test, species distribution stacking map, differential volcano map, Some of the functions used in amplicon grouping such as Manhattan diagrams, ternary diagrams, Lefse, STAMPs, etc.

7. Is it free? Personal use is completely free and will not be charged in the future.

Users can use the EcoAmp software free of charge in the following cases:

Academic purpose: Users use EcoAmp for the purpose of carrying out academic research related to ecology, including but not limited to research on the structure and function of ecosystems, biodiversity conservation research, ecological model construction and verification, and other academic topics. At the same time, users can share EcoAmp with others for academic exchanges, discussions, and training activities on specific academic issues (public welfare training) among members of the group, so as to promote the collision of academic ideas and the inheritance of research methods, and promote the in-depth development of academic research.

Public Welfare Purpose: Users who use EcoAmp to engage in non-profit public welfare projects with an ecological nature can also use the software for free. In these public welfare scenarios, users can use EcoAmp as a tool for public welfare training courses within schools and other educational institutions, to teach students ecological knowledge and skills, cultivate public awareness of ecological environmental protection, and help the development of public welfare undertakings.

Users are required to obtain authorization for use of EcoAmp software in the following cases:

Commercial Purposes: Advance authorization must be obtained when users plan to use EcoAmp for commercial operations or for-profit activities. This includes, but is not limited to, using EcoAmp as an analytical tool for business consulting firms to provide business consulting services in the ecological field to clients for a fee; Or, in a commercial training course, use EcoAmp as a core part of the training content and charge the trainee for the training; or when EcoAmp is bundled with commercial software or services as part of a product. Regardless of the form of commercial use, as long as it involves direct or indirect profit-making activities, it needs to be authorized accordingly. Fee-based services: Even if the purpose of using EcoAmp is not entirely for commercial gain, as long as it involves fee-based services, such as holding paid training seminars on ecological data analysis, even if the lectures include some academic sharing, it is still necessary to obtain authorization for the use of EcoAmp in advance due to the existence of fee-based behavior. This reflects respect for the intellectual property rights of the software, and ensures that the software developer can reasonably control the scope of commercial application of the software, and avoid unauthorized profit-making use that damages their legitimate rights and interests.
